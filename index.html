    <p id="p2">Who is Gwendolyn Thomas? I'm glad you asked. Leader, Influencer, Evangelist, Daughter, & Friend are a few titles that I hold 
        however my favorite title is "Servant". I serve in many capacities and I have made it my life mission to spread the gospel in any space I occupy. 
        I hold a degree in Psychology from Cal State Northridge, Certification as an Evagenlist from Bethany Bible College and was recently ordained as Minister.

    and my potential is endless. #HappyBrowsing
