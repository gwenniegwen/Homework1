        <p id="p2">Who is Gwendolyn Thomas? I'm glad you asked. Leader, Influencer, Evangelist, Daughter, & Friend are a
            few titles that I hold
            however my favorite title is "Servant". I serve in many capacities currently working as a Quality Assurance 
            Coordinator by day and (soon to be) Full Stack Web Developer by night. Above all I have made it my life mission to
            spread the gospel in any space I occupy. I hold a degree in Psychology from Cal State Northridge, Certification as an Evagenlist from Bethany Bible
            College and was recently ordained as Minister.

            But enough about me, let's get down to business. The reason you are here.... is to check out my skills; all of
            the above sounds great but can I preform? Again I'm glad you asked. Click the Portfolio link up top to the right or <a
                href="./portfolio.html">click here</a> to browse my recent work. I'm confident that this will showcase my skill-set. BUT WAIT THERES MORE...
            The best news is that this is just the tip of the iceberg. I'm a quick learner, thirsty for knowledge
            and my potential is endless. #HappyBrowsing
